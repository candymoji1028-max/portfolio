        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm currently taking my very first course in front-end development, and I'm excited to learn how websites are built from the ground up. I'm still new to HTML, CSS, and GitHub, but I'm enjoying the process and learning something new each week.</p>
        <p>  I created this portfolio as part of my coursework. Since this is my first step into web development, I'm using this space to practice, experiment, and show the projects I've completed so far. I also hope that building this portfolio will give me more opportunities as I continue learning and growing my skills.</p>
        <p>My goal is to keep improving my skills, build more projects, and eventually feel confident contributing to real front-end work. I'm excited to continue learning and see how far I can grow from here.</p>
